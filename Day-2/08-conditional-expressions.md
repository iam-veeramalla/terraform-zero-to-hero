# Conditional Expressions

Conditional expressions in Terraform are used to define conditional logic within your configurations. They allow you to make decisions or set values based on conditions. Conditional expressions are typically used to control whether resources are created or configured based on the evaluation of a condition.

The syntax for a conditional expression in Terraform is:

```hcl
condition ? true_val : false_val
```

- `condition` is an expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.
- `true_val` is the value that is returned if the condition is `true`.
- `false_val` is the value that is returned if the condition is `false`.

Here are some common use cases and examples of how to use conditional expressions in Terraform:

## Conditional Resource Creation Example

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count = var.create_instance ? 1 : 0

  ami           = "ami-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

In this example, the `count` attribute of the `aws_instance` resource uses a conditional expression. If the `create_instance` variable is `true`, it creates one EC2 instance. If `create_instance` is `false`, it creates zero instances, effectively skipping resource creation.

# Conditional Variable Assignment Example

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment type"
  type        = string
  default     = "development"
}

variable "production_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for production subnet"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

variable "development_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for development subnet"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.2.0/24"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-sg"
  description = "Example security group"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = var.environment == "production" ? [var.production_subnet_cidr] : [var.development_subnet_cidr]
  }
}

```

In this example, the `ingress` block uses a conditional expression to assign a value to the `subnet_cidr` local variable based on the value of the `environment` variable. If `environment` is set to `"production"`, it uses the `production_subnet_cidr` variable; otherwise, it uses the `development_subnet_cidr` variable.

## Conditional Resource Configuration 

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example-sg"
  description = "Example security group"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = var.enable_ssh ? ["0.0.0.0/0"] : []
  }
}
```

In this example, the `ingress` block within the `aws_security_group` resource uses a conditional expression to control whether SSH access is allowed. If `enable_ssh` is `true`, it allows SSH traffic from any source (`"0.0.0.0/0"`); otherwise, it allows no inbound traffic.

Conditional expressions in Terraform provide a powerful way to make decisions and customize your infrastructure deployments based on various conditions and variables. They enhance the flexibility and reusability of your Terraform configurations.
